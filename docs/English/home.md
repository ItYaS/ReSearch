# Pulling documentation
**Pulling** is an open source python repository for working with files of different extensions. 
The repository now supports .txt .rtf .pdf .docx .csv .avro .json formats.

To start using the repository, first install python from its [official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
After that, install the pulling package through the console.

> **> pip install pulling**

Further in the documentation there will be such windows:
> Code will be here (input)
>> And here's the output (output)

## Future
Such a repository can be extended for life. That's what I will do. 
But the next version (where there will be working from other formats) will not be released soon. 
So, keep this repository and be patient.

In the future, I want to work with .orc .rcf .parquet .feather (and one day .doc .odt), add conversion to other extensions for all formats, add new functions, and new formats.

## Communication
If you have any questions about pulling or have problems, please, write adequately! Thank you very much for your understanding.
