# Pulling
Pulling is an open source python repository for parsing data from files and web pages. Documentation in English can be found [here](https://github.com/ItYaS/pulling/wiki).
The repository now supports .txt .rtf .pdf .docx .csv .avro .json formats and parsing data from tags(p, h, a, img, span) of web pages.

## Future
Such a repository can be extended for life. That's what I will do. But the next version (where there will be parsing from other formats) will not be released soon, because in 2020 and 2021, I am preparing for exams and admission to the Institute. So, keep this repository and be patient.

In the future, I want to parse .orc .rcf .parquet .feather (and one day .doc .odt), add conversion to other extensions for all formats, add new functions, and new formats.

## Creation idea 
Before appearing as you see it, my code and idea have gone through many stages. But it all started when I was quarantined (in 2020) and my homework was sent in a file with the extension .docx. And Word hung up on me and didn't want to open the homemade file. And I came up with a brilliant idea - to write a parser to pull out my school lesson. Then I began to expand my parser and write a web platform for parsing (but there was an unpleasant bug from which I did not put it on hosting). And then the code for this site I decided to rewrite for the repository.

Especially, I don't think anybody else would spend so much time looking for extracting text from other extensions.
There are no such libraries that really work, for example, on windows. Just no! (by now)
