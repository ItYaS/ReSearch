# Pulling
**Pulling** is an open source python repository for working with files of different extensions. Documentation in English can be found [here](https://github.com/ItYaS/pulling/wiki).
The repository now supports .txt .rtf .pdf .docx .csv .avro .json formats.

## Install
To start using the repository, first install python from its [official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
After that, install the pulling package through the console. 

```python
pip install pulling
``` 

You can see examples of the use of pulling in [test/pulling_test.py](https://github.com/ItYaS/pulling/blob/master/tests/pulling_test.py).

## Future
Such a repository can be extended for life. That's what I will do. But the next version (where there will be parsing from other formats) will not be released soon, because in 2020 and 2021, I am preparing for exams and admission to the Institute. So, keep this repository and be patient.

In the future, I want to parse .orc .rcf .parquet .feather (and one day .doc .odt), add conversion to other extensions for all formats, add new functions, and new formats.

## Communication
If you have any questions about pulling or have problems, please, write adequately! Thank you very much for your understanding.
