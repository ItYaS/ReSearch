# Pulling
Pulling is an open source python repository for parsing data from files and web pages. Documentation in English can be found [here](https://github.com/ItYaS/pulling/wiki).
The repository now supports .txt .rtf .pdf .docx .csv .avro .json formats and parsing data from tags(p, h, b, big, small, i, strong, sub, sup, ins, del, span, img, video, audio) of standart web pages.

## Future
Such a repository can be extended for life. That's what I will do. But the next version (where there will be parsing from other formats) will not be released soon, because in 2020 and 2021, I am preparing for exams and admission to the Institute. So, keep this repository and be patient.

In the future, I want to parse .orc .rcf .parquet .feather (and one day .doc .odt), add conversion to other extensions for all formats, add new functions, and new formats.
